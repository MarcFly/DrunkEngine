# Authors
The people currently working in this engine are Andreu Sacasas and Marc Torres, currently 3rd Year students coursing Design and Game Development at CITM, a center abscribed to the UPC.

# Usage
DrunkEngine will automatically load a preview .FBX with a house and a texture added, in order to view more just Drag&Drop other ones.
If your model has textures already set, put all the files needed into the "Test Models and Textures" folder in order to have it properly loaded at the same time. You can also Drag&Drop textures to apply it to the whole model!

To move around the space, either orbit around with Alt+LeftClick or move in first person using RightClick+WASD. If you wander off to far, don't worry, press F to focus again to the current model.

In the menu bar, an array of options are available, take some time to look into it. We specially recommend using the object properties window, under the Tools Tab, or open it with "M".

All keybindings are rebindable, make use of your perfect layout.
